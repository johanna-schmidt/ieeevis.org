The IEEE VIS 2025 Poster Program offers a timely venue to present and discuss original work or highlights of recent work published or presented in another venue (please see the plagiarism statement in the end) through a forum that encourages graphical presentation, demonstration, and active engagement with IEEE VIS participants.

The presentation of posters will happen as a physical event at the conference. There will be 1-2 dedicated poster sessions where poster authors can meet and discuss their work with conference participants. An additional web presence of posters will supplement the traditional physical installation of poster boards.
